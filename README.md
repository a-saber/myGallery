# My Gallery

My Gallery is a Flutter application developed as an interview task. This app allows users to log in, view a gallery of their images, and upload new images either by capturing them with the camera or selecting them from the phone's gallery. Despite its initial purpose, this app has proven to be very useful and serves as a solid foundation for further development.
